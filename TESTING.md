# LIDAR Archaeological Scoring System - Testing Results

## Scoring Calculations ✅

The scoring system correctly implements profile-based weighted calculations:

### Test 1: Prehistoric Settlement
- **Input**: High water access (2), moderate other factors
- **Result**: Total Score 19.5 (High probability)
- **Validation**: Correctly weights water access at 35% for prehistoric profile

### Test 2: Roman Military Site
- **Input**: High morphology (3), strategic elevation (2)
- **Result**: Total Score 22.75 (High probability)
- **Validation**: Correctly emphasizes geometric features (25%) and elevation (20%)

### Test 3: Low Scoring Site
- **Input**: Minimal scores across all factors
- **Result**: Total Score 1.95 (Low probability)
- **Validation**: Correctly identifies low-potential sites

### Test 4: Sensitivity Analysis
- **Finding**: Single factor (data quality) can contribute 5.85 points alone
- **Implication**: System correctly identifies when one factor dominates
- **Mitigation**: Sensitivity analysis component will flag this bias

## Random Sampling Compliance ✅

The 10:2:1:1 ratio enforcement works correctly:

- **Good Compliance (100%)**: 20 high, 4 medium, 2 low, 2 empty
- **Poor Compliance (33%)**: 30 high, 3 medium, 1 low, 0 empty
- **System correctly calculates compliance percentages**

## Key Features Verified

1. **Profile-Based Scoring**: Different weights correctly applied per archaeological context
2. **Probability Thresholds**: Low (0-4), Medium (5-8), High (9+) working as designed
3. **Bias Detection**: Single-factor dominance correctly identified
4. **Compliance Tracking**: Random sampling ratios properly calculated

## Application Interface

- Disclaimer modal on startup ✅
- Tab-based navigation (Scoring, Analysis, Guide) ✅
- Source verification checklist ✅
- Alternative explanations panel ✅
- Sensitivity analysis visualization ✅
- Random sampling tracker ✅

## Testing Instructions

1. **Access the application**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Accept the disclaimer** to proceed
3. **Test different profiles**: Select prehistoric, Roman military, etc.
4. **Enter test data** in the simplified scoring table
